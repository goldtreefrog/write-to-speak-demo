# Write to Speak Demo App

This is an app in progress. So far I have completed screen layouts that are not functional yet, but you can get an idea of what they look like - for mobile devices - with dummy data by going [here](https://write-to-speak-demo.netlify.com/).

The name of the app here on Github is "Write to Speak Demo," to distinguish it from the prior "Write to Speak" written in JQuery, which did not have a database. (This latest version will be a rewrite in React/Redux with MongoDB.)
